# WildTracker 
While I initially envisioned this app as a way to provide an additional source of data to government agencies to allow for more informed wildlife management decisions, I have realized this app, in a much more developed state, could lead to a social media app based around wildlife sightings. 

Utilizing Google Maps Platform users are able to enter in the location, date, time, species and a note for any given wildlife sighting. Once entered the sighting then populates a marker on the map and, once clicked, an info window will open diplaying the information that was entered.

The users sightings are stored in their profile page while the home page displays sightings by all other users. 

Below is a brief demo. Thanks for checking it out!
